------------
	-> Only read nSites: 0 will therefore prepare next chromosome (or exit)

	-> NB NB output is no longer log probs of the frequency spectrum!
	-> Output is now simply the expected values! 
	-> You can convert to the old format simply with log(norm(x))

	-> Please check that it has converged!
	-> You can add start new optimization by supplying -sfs FILE, where is >FILE from this run
	-> -maxIter INT -tole FLOAT
