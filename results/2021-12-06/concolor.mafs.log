	-> angsd version: 0.935-53-gf475f10 (htslib: 1.14-7-g1d79f44) build(Nov 16 2021 12:06:02)
	-> angsd -vcf-gl concolor.recode.vcf -fai ../../data/reference.fa.fai -doMaf 1 -doMajorMinor 1 -out concolor 
	-> Inputtype is vcf/bcf
	-> VCF still beta. Remember that
	   1. indels are are discarded
	   2. will use chrom, pos PL columns
	   3. GL tags are interpreted as log10 and are scaled to ln (NOT USED)
	   4. GP tags are interpreted directly as unscaled post probs (spec says phredscaled...) (NOT USED)
	   5. FILTER column is currently NOT used (not sure what concensus is)
	   6. -sites does NOT work with vcf input but -r does
	   7. vcffilereading is still BETA, please report strange behaviour
	   8. Consider adding '-doMajorMinor 1'
	-> No indel tag in vcf/bcf file, will therefore not be able to filter out indels
