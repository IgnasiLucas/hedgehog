# I am looking at the variation discovered in the alignments of the reads to
# the reference genome with freebayes. The strategy has been to generate first
# a vcf file with all potentially interesting sites, being permissive with the
# quality filters. We can always filter at later steps of the analysis. In the
# folder 2016-11-18, I created the megapool.vcf and selected biallelic sites
# with either a SNP or an indel, and with a minimum quality of 40. Here, I will
# add complex variants and multiple nucleotide variants, and also triallelic
# sites. The rationale is that there are relatively few variants shared among
# populations, because they are different species. Given the distance between
# populations, I expect triallelic variants to contribute relatively more to
# the amount of shared variants than to the total number of variants. That is,
# the previous filtering of triallelic variants could have removed proportionally
# more shared variants than population-specific ones.
