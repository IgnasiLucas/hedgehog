#
# After having shown that regions of the genome where Er55_AU7 retain E. europaeus
# ancestry from a relatively recent admixture event are also enriched in signatures
# of historical introgression among the rest of individuals (detected with the D
# test), it is necessary to characterize those regions. If introgressed variation
# lingers where it is less harmful, it would be found mostly where functional
# constraint is low. Functional constraint could be detected by looking at the
# annotation files. Also, comparing polymorphism and divergence between two or more
# loci (Hudson, Kreitman, AguadÃ© test), we can gain insight.
#
# Also, there is no need to limit our analysis to the regions where Er55_AU7 retained
# E. europaeus ancestry. That's just one case, and others would have improved our power.
# The question is that with that case we proved an association between two types of
# introgression signal. Now, we can look for an association between introgression
# signal and functional constraint. For example, estimating D and f statistics both
# for genic and intergenic regions. Also, estimating either D or f statistics in
# windows, where both divergence and polymorphism is also estimated. The latter can be
# done with Simon H. Martin's scripts: https://github.com/simonhmartin/genomics_general

# Different vcf files are optimized for different statistics:
VCF1=../2018-09-26/ErinaceusAndHemiechinus_r1e1c1h1.vcf
VCF2=../2018-09-26/ErinMaxMiss63_r10e10c4.vcf
# This is the folder where Simon H. Martin's genomic_general repository is cloned:
GENOMICS_GENERAL=~/bin/genomics_general
POPDATA=../../data/populations.txt

# I will exclude both the hybrid and the other admixed individual, in order to work only
# with the historical signal of introgression. It will help interpretation.
