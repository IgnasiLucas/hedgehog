# These are numbers of sites polymorphic within a population that show significatn deficit
# or excess of heterozygous individuals, or not, at 0.05 significance level, according to
# the tests performed by vcftools. Sites may be counted more than once, when polymorphic in
# more than one population.
Heterozygous deficit:  37784 (16.1252%)
Heterozyous excess:     1695 (0.7234%)
