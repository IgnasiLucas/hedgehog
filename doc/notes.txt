Hybrids between E. europaeus and E. roumanicus have been described, on morphological basis,
in Central Europe since the 1970s (citations in Bogdanov et al. 2009). They have also been
produced in laboratoris. Genetic evidence of the hybridization is not abundant, but exists
(Bogdanov et al. 2009).

Until now, researcher have studied the phylogeography of hedgehogs in Europe with mitochondrial
(Seddon et al. 2001) and nuclear (Seddon et al. 2001, Berggren et al. 2005) markers. The interpretation of those
results was then difficult before the realization that E. concolor was actually two spcies:
E. concolor and E. roumanicus, that is Southern and Northern white-breasted hedgehogs, respectively.
